"""
H3 Shot Length  (single model-free source for shot length)
==========================================================
Holds ONE shot-length value and emits it as both seconds and a grid-aligned
H3 frame count. Because it never reads the model, it can sit upstream of
Kijai's Model Preview Override without creating a cycle -- unlike the preview
node or the sampler, which read the model to compute their frame counts and so
cannot feed anything that produces the model.

Wire:
  H3 Shot Length (seconds) -> H3 Long Videos FL2VA (shot_seconds)
  H3 Shot Length (frames)  -> Model Preview Override (preview_frames)

One value, entered once here, drives both -- no manual re-entry, no cycle.

Note: this is a FIXED shot length you choose. The sampler's *auto* (VRAM-
picked) length can't be used for preview_frames, because computing it requires
reading the model, which is the very dependency that creates the loop. Set the
sampler's shot_seconds from this node's `seconds` output so the two agree.
