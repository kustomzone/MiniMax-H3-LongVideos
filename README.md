# H3-LongVideos

Long **MiniMax-H3 video with synchronised audio** from a single prompt, in ComfyUI.

H3 renders about 15 seconds at a time. This node turns a written scene into a chain of
shots and joins them into one continuous video. Your text reaches the model word for
word.

## Install

Copy this folder into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` and restart the ComfyUI **server**.

Requires ComfyUI 0.31+ with native MiniMax-H3 support (tested on 0.33).

## What to load

| | |
|---|---|
| **UNET** | a MiniMax-H3 model — a [hybrid fl2va/ref2va merge](https://huggingface.co/smhfacct/Minimax-H3-fl2va-ref2va-hybrid-models) works best |
| **CLIP** | H3's text encoder, loader type `minimax` |
| **VAE** | the H3 **video** VAE |
| **audio VAE** | the H3 **audio** VAE — a separate file, and it must be the *converted* one |

```
UNETLoader ─┐                     images ─> Video Combine / Save Video
CLIPLoader ─┼─> H3 Long Videos ─> audio  ─┘
VAELoader ──┘                     info   ─> Show Text
```

`prompt` is an input socket — wire a multiline text node into it.

**Set `plan_only` first.** It reports the shot split, the lengths and every warning,
without rendering.

## Writing the prompt

**One paragraph = one shot**, separated by a blank line. The first paragraph is the
**scene**, prepended to every shot; the rest are beats.

```
Natural daylight, hard sun. A farm with a barn.

Dom drives a van down the driveway and stops in front of the barn.

Dom gets out and walks to the back of it.

Mara steps out of the barn and asks him: "Is that the last one?"
```

Dialogue goes in **double quotes**. Use the `anchor` widget if you want the framing
carried separately — then every paragraph is a beat.

### The character sheet

A paragraph of `Name: attributes` lines, or the `character_memory` widget. Each shot is
given the entries for the people its beat names, and nobody else.

```
Nora: <Picture 1>, 34, she, tall, red hair, green canvas jacket, brown boots.
Mike: he, 41, dark hair, navy overalls.
```

- **Declare a pronoun.** It is what lets *"he takes her coat off"* find the right two
  people.
- **One name per person.** `Dan` in some beats and `Mike` in others reads as two.
- **Every name needs an entry**, or the model invents that person differently each shot.

`<Picture N>` means `ref_image_N`, the socket. Tag it onto the person or thing it
depicts and it follows them; untagged, a reference goes on every shot.

## Settings

| setting | value |
|---|---|
| `cfg` | **1.0** — H3 is CFG-free; the negative prompt is never evaluated |
| `sampler_name` | `res_multistep`, or `euler` with PDD Acc |
| `scheduler` | `simple` |
| `shift_video` / `shift_audio` | **12 / 3** — keep them near 4:1 or the audio breaks |
| `steps` | 6–8 with a turbo/distill LoRA, 20+ without |
| `megapixels` | 1.0 is H3's native budget; lower is faster and leaner |
| `shot_seconds` | the cap on each shot |
| `shot_length` | `from the beat` sizes each shot from its own line; `fixed` gives every shot `shot_seconds` |
| `ambient_level` | ambience under the whole soundtrack, built from your scene. 0 is off; 0.15–0.3 is a bed you notice only when it stops |
| `ambient_audio` | optional — wire a recording to use instead of the built one |

Ambience is mixed, never prompted. Scoring a silent shot from text needs the audio
branch left open, and an open branch on a joint model invents a voice for the face to
lip-sync to. The bed is built from the room your scene names, so it needs no file,
and shaped noise cannot speak. It makes tone — air, rumble, hum, water, a clock — so
a scene whose ambience is birdsong gets the room, not the birds; `info` says when.

Everything else is a switch, on by default, and each has a tooltip explaining what it
does and what it costs. Hover before you change one.

## Outputs

| slot | what it is |
|---|---|
| `images` | the finished frames |
| `audio` | the synchronised soundtrack |
| `info` | what the node did, and every warning — **read this** |
| `script` | the exact per-shot text it sent |
| `frames_per_shot`, `total_frames`, `shots`, `video_seconds` | for downstream nodes |

When a shot renders something you did not expect, read `script`. It shows precisely what
that shot was told, and `info` says why.

## Other nodes here

- **H3 Shot Length** — seconds to a valid H3 frame count.
- **H3 Overlay** — watermark and intro title composited onto finished frames.
- **H3 Model Inspector** — checkpoint precision, and whether your card runs it natively.

## Notes

- No negative prompt: H3 is CFG-free at `cfg 1`.
- No denoise control: fixed at 1.0, because partial denoise desyncs the joint
  audio/video schedule.
- **Widgets are restored by position.** If they read NaN, right-click the node →
  **Fix node (recreate)**, set your values, and save the workflow again.
