"""Tests for H3 Long Videos.

Only what the node actually decides: how a prompt becomes shots, how a shot is
sized, and which shots get silence or a reference. There is no prompt-rewriting
layer to test any more -- your text goes through verbatim, and the test that
matters most is the one asserting exactly that.
