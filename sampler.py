"""
H3 Long Videos -- chain MiniMax-H3 shots into one continuous video with audio.

Rebuilt from scratch. The previous version grew a large prompt-engineering layer
that wrote continuity guards into every shot; measured, the user's own beat was
under 4% of the conditioning and the rest was boilerplate arguing with it. None of
that is here. What a shot is told is: your scene text, then your beat, verbatim.

What this node does is the part a prompt cannot do -- the mechanics of chaining:

  * splits the prompt into beats on blank lines, one beat per shot;
  * gives every shot the SAME length, so one seed is one noise field across the
    chain (noise is drawn to the latent's shape, so unequal lengths mean unrelated
    noise from the same seed, and detail resets at every cut);
  * hands each shot the previous shot's last frame as its keyframe, encoded the
    way H3 expects a keyframe to be encoded (one frame -> the 5f grid point);
  * keeps identity references on every shot, which is the only fixed anchor a long
    chain has against drift;
  * anchors the audio branch to real silence on shots with no quoted line, because
    H3 is a joint model and an unconditioned audio stream invents a voice that the
    picture then lip-syncs to.

Everything about what the video should CONTAIN is yours to write.

    decode does not fit until it goes.

    `keep` is what must NOT be evicted on the way. It was `keep_loaded=[]`, which
    unloaded every resident model -- including the video VAE, which ComfyUI then
    reloaded three lines later to run the decode. An evict-and-reload of the thing
    about to be used, once per shot, on every card. Peak VRAM is identical either

    This is the fix for VRAM ratcheting across a long chain. soft_empty_cache()

    ComfyUI keeps the Qwen3-VL text encoder (~14.6GB) and both VAEs resident in
    current_loaded_models alongside the DiT. Each shot re-encodes the prompt
    (text encoder), encodes the handoff keyframe (video VAE), then samples (DiT),
    so all three compete for the card.

    ComfyUI does free ahead of each load -- load_models_gpu() calls free_memory()
    for what it is about to need (model_management.py:975), so the weight path is
    not purely reactive. What it cannot size for is a long chain's ACTIVATIONS on
    a card where the DiT is most of the VRAM. Freeing explicitly, right after
    conditioning is built and before sampling, keeps only what the sampler needs.

    ASKED FOR HONESTLY, and this is the expensive one. free_memory computes
    `memory_to_free = memory_required - get_free_memory(device)`, so 1e30 meant
    "unload everything but the DiT" on every shot, unconditionally -- on a 48GB card
    with room for all of it as readily as on a 16GB one. What it unloads is the
    ~14.6GB text encoder and both VAEs, and the next shot re-encodes the prompt and
    the handoff keyframe, so all three come straight back. On a machine whose RAM is
    already full of finished frames they come back from DISK, once per shot, which is
    the thrashing this was reported as.

    The DiT can size its own activations -- memory_required(shape) is what ComfyUI
    itself calls before a load -- so ask for that. A card with room frees nothing and
    keeps the encoder resident; a card without frees exactly as much as it must.
