"""Publish this node to BOTH remotes, and verify what landed.

    python test_node.py && python test_smoke.py && python test_readme.py
    python publish.py "commit message"

GitHub and the Hugging Face mirror share no merge base, so HF is not a git push
-- it is a file upload per file. That made it easy to push a subset by accident
and leave the mirror half-updated, so the file list lives HERE rather than in
whatever script was to hand, and every upload is verified by downloading the file
back and comparing SHA-256.

config.json is in the list for a reason that is not obvious: the Hub counts a
download as an HTTP request for a QUERY FILE, and with no library declared it
looks for config.json. A repo without one is never counted -- this one read 0
downloads against 93 likes until it was added. test_readme.py fails if it goes
missing; this makes sure it is actually uploaded.
